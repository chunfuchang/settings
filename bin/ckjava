# Purpose: Check whether java is the script we expect
# Description:
#	Under cygwin, we have to manipulate CLASS_PATH befor invoking the java
#	executable. It is the job of /home/bin/java. And, this script test
#	whether the path points to the java correctly
#	To see the result, check whether $? is 0
